# My-Hackerrank-Solutions
A solutions repo for some hackerrank problems, the solutions are not the optimal solutions, but ones that from my perspective are easier and mostly brute in nature, it is for people who want simple and easy to read code. Better performing solutions must be available, but this is basically for noobs like me.

Problem Name : Electronic Shop - Please find problem definition on Hackerrank.
